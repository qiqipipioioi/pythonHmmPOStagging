<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Chinese Treebank 8.0, Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) Catalog Number LDC2013T21 
  and ISBN 1-58563-661-4, consists of approximately 1.5 million words of annotated 
  and parsed text from Chinese newswire, government documents, magazine articles, 
  various broadcast news and broadcast conversation programs, web newsgroups and 
  weblogs.</p>
<p>The Chinese Treebank project began at the University of Pennsylvania in 1998, 
  continued at the University of Colorado and then moved to <a href="http://www.cs.brandeis.edu/%7Ellc/page2/page2.html">Brandeis 
  University</a>. The project's goal is to provide a large, part-of-speech tagged 
  and fully bracketed Chinese language corpus. The first delivery, Chinese Treebank 
  1.0, contained 100,000 syntactically annotated words from Xinhua News Agency 
  newswire. It was later corrected and released in 2001 as <a href="http://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2001T11">Chinese 
  Treebank 2.0 (LDC2001T11)</a> and consisted of approximately 100,000 words. 
  The LDC released <a href="http://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2004T05">Chinese Treebank 
  4.0 (LDC2004T05)</a>, an updated version containing roughly 400,000 words, in 
  2004. A year later, LDC published the 500,000 word <a href="http://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2005T01">Chinese 
  Treebank 5.0 (LDC2005T01)</a>. <a href="http://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2007T36">Chinese 
  Treebank 6.0 (LDC2007T36)</a>, released in 2007, consisted of 780,000 words. 
  <a href="http://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2010T07">Chinese Treebank 7.0 (LDC2010T08)</a>, 
  released in 2010, added new annotated newswire data, broadcast material and 
  web text to the approximate total of one million words. Chinese Treebank 8.0 
  adds new annotated data from newswire, magazine articles and government documents.</p>


<h3>Data</h3>
<p>There are 3,007 text files in this release, containing 71,369 sentences, 1,620,561 
  words, 2,589,848 characters (hanzi or foreign). The data is provided in UTF-8 
  encoding, and the annotation has Penn Treebank-style labeled brackets. Details 
  of the annotation standard can be found in the enclosed segmentation, POS-tagging 
  and bracketing guidelines. The data is provided in four different formats: raw 
  text, word segmented, word segmented and POS-tagged, and syntactically bracketed 
  formats. All files were automatically verified and manually checked.</p>
